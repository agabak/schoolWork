<h3>Instructions: </h3>
<p>Please complete the following exercises using Javascript loops as indicated.  Please place your code on this page. Use runtime scripts unless told otherwise. </p>
<p>1. Create a WHILE loop that will print out the  numbers 0 to 4 each on a seperate line. </p>
<p>
  <script>
    let x= 0;		//loop control variable
    while(x <= 4)		//check if the condition is been met
    {
        
        document.write( x + "<br/>");	//display the value of x each time through the loop
        x++;				//  increment the control variable
    }
</script> 
</p>
<p>2. Create a FOR loop that will print out the  numbers 4 to 0 each on a seperate line.</p>
<p>
  <script>
    
    for(x = 4; x >= 0; x--) {
      document.write( x + "<br/>");	//display the value of x each time through the loop
    }

  </script>
</p>
<p>3. Create a loop that will print 1 to 5 each in its own paragraph element.</p>
<p>
  <script>

    for(x = 1; x <= 5; x++) {
      document.write("<p>" + x + "<p/>") // display the value of x its own paragraph element.
    }

  </script>
</p>
<p>4. Create a loop that will print out the following numbers (5,10,15,20,25...) until one is greater than 40.</p>
<p>
  <script>

    for(x = 5; x <= 40; x+=5) {

        document.write(x + ",")   // display value from 5 incremental by 5 until reach 40
    }
  </script>
</p>
<p>5. Create a loop that will print out  6 of the following messages (Option 1, Option 2, Option 3, etc. ) as options within the drop down menu below.</p>
<p>
  <label>Select an Option! 
    <select name="select" id="select">
      <script>
         for(x = 1; x <=6; x++) {
           document.write("<option>" +  x  + "</option>")  // print out the option from 1 to 6
         }
      </script>
    </select>
  </label>
</p>
